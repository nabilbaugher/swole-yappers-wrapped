This is a fun wrapped project for my gym group, Swole Yappers.
We've split the images into landscape and portrait so we know how to handle them at display time (read the manifest in app/lib/images.ts for the details).

My outline:

- Intro
- Num workouts (animate a counter going up to 41; no image)
- We had fun
  - funny1, funny2, funny3 webp
- Amount of yap: (animate a counter going quickly up from 1 yap → high number yaps → uncountable yaps; no image)
- We had 20+ unique attendees
  - group1, group2, group3 webp
- Least attended day: legs
  - Vertical photo full background title “cooked_bens.webp”
- Most creative exercise: shivani
  - Vertical photo full background title “shivani.webp”

  1. Swerd - 19
  2. Steph - 17
